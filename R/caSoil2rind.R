#' @title Route of contamination of cantaloupe from soil to rind
#'
#' @description
#' The function [caSoil2rind()] evaluates the contamination of cantaloupes through soil only.
#' It considers soil contamination characteristics such as prevalence `pSoil` and concentration `c_soil` as well as the
#' quantity of soil deposited on the cantaloupe rind. Furthermore, the algorithm allows for the use of foils to protect
#' cantaloupe from soil contamination, and the user must provide the probability of growing cantaloupes using such protective foils.
#' `pSoil` and `c_soil` have to be chosen by the user according to existing data; whereas `pSoil` is conditional to several risk factors.
#' The identified risk factors \insertCite{Background2022}{qraLm} are:
#'   \enumerate{
#'      \item irrigation in the previous days before harvesting; and
#'      \item the use of organic fertilizer.
#'      }
#' which affect `pSoil` as associated odds-ratios (`F_irrig_rain` and `fManure`). In this context, the user has to define the proportion of fields
#' practising irrigation prior to harvest or undergoing rain (`p_irrig_rain`), and the proportion of fields using organic amendments (`pManure`).
#'
#' @param nLots Size of the Monte Carlo simulation (scalar).
#' @param sizeLot Number of cantaloupes per cultivation lot or field (scalar).
#' @param pSoil Probability of contamination of soil (provided by the user, \eqn{default=0.089} according to \insertCite{Strawn2013a;textual}{qraLm})
#' @param fManure Odds-ratio estimate associated to use or organic amendment in soil (\eqn{default=7.0} according to \insertCite{Strawn2013b;textual}{qraLm})
#' @param pManure Proportion of fields using organic amendments (provided by user, \eqn{default=0.5})
#' @param fIrrigRaining Odds-ratio estimate associated to use of irrigation and raining events up to 2 days before harvest
#' (\eqn{default=25.0} according to \insertCite{Weller2015;textual}{qraLm}).
#' @param pIrrigRaining Proportion of fields that undergo irrigation or raining just previous harvest (provided by user, \eqn{default=0.1}).
#' @param cSoilLogMin (log10 CFU/g) Minimum value of the triangular distribution describing variability of concentration
#' (according to \insertCite{Dowe1997;textual}{qraLm} \eqn{default=-1\ log10\ CFU/g}).
#' @param cSoilLogMode (log10 CFU/g) Mode value of the triangular distribution describing variability of concentration
#' (according to \insertCite{Dowe1997;textual}{qraLm} \eqn{default=0.6\ log10\ CFU/g}).
#' @param cSoilLogMax (log10 CFU/g) Maximum value of the triangular distribution describing variability of concentration
#' (according to  \insertCite{Dowe1997;textual}{qraLm}: \eqn{default=1.48\ log10\ CFU/g}).
#' @param qSoilMin (`g`) Minimum value of the triangular distribution describing variability of quantity of soil deposited on cantaloupe (\eqn{default=0.05\ g}).
#' @param qSoilMode (`g`) Mode value of the triangular distribution describing variability of quantity of soil deposited on cantaloupe (\eqn{default=0.5\ g}).
#' @param qSoilMax (`g`) Maximum value of the triangular distribution describing variability of quantity of soil deposited on cantaloupe (\eqn{default=5\ g}).
#' @param pFoil Proportion of fields grown in foil (e.g. plastic mulch) (EKE: \eqn{default=0.5})
#' @param rFoil Reduction fraction of the quantity of soil transferred to rind (EKE: \eqn{default=0.9})

#' @return A list of two elements:

#' @note The prevalence in soil, `pSoil`, must be provided by the user according to existing data. \insertCite{Background2022;textual}{qraLm}
#' lists various prevalence estimates in different regions of the world. A `default=0.089` \insertCite{Strawn2013a}{qraLm} is taken.
#' `pSoil` is conditional to several risk factors; yet this functions is based upon two risk factors:
#'   \enumerate{
#'     \item irrigation or rain occurring prior to harvesting, whose odds-ratio has been estimated at 25.0 when taking place 24 hours before
#'      harvesting \insertCite{Weller2015}{qraLm}; and
#'     \item application of organic fertilizer, whose odds-ratio has been estimated at 7.0 when manure is applied within 1 year \insertCite{Strawn2013b}{qraLm}.
#'     }
#' The distribution about the concentration of \emph{L. monocytogenes} in soil is represented as a triangular distribution,
#' using data from \insertCite{Dowe1997;textual}{qraLm}, who reported a mean of 4.0 MPN \emph{L. monocytogenes}/ g soil, with a 95%
#' confidence interval of \eqn{<1.0-28\ MPN/g}.
