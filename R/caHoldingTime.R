#' @title Holding time of cantaloupes post-harvest
#'
#' @description
#' The function [caHoldingTime()] simulates the survival of \emph{L. monocytogenes} on cantaloupe rind
#' during post-harvest holding time or during any short storage before cantaloupes are washed in the
#' packinghouse. The algorithm calculates decline in  \emph{L. monocytogenes}, and not growth on surfaces,
#' because it is assumed that if any event that injured the rind occurred, it would have been very recent (at harvest),
#' and the holding time would be too short that any growth on the bruised rind would be unlikely or negligible.
#' The user can define a probability `pCooled` that the lot of just-harvested cantaloupes is kept at cold temperatures (4-10 \eqn{^\circ} C).
#' If \eqn{p\_Cooled=0}, the algorithm will evaluate the survival of \emph{L. monocytogenes} on cantaloupes held at ambient temperature (25 \eqn{^\circ} C).

#' @param data a list of:

#'                 the cantaloupe rind, from contaminated harvested lots;}

#' @note Data on the survival of \emph{L. monocytogenes} on the intact rind of two varieties of cantaloupe stored at 4, 10 and 25 \eqn{^\circ} C were
#' extracted from \insertCite{Nyarko2016;textual}{qraLm}. A non-linear mixed model based on the two-parameter Weibull decay equation with random effects
#' on melon variety showed that the time to achieve the first log10 reduction (`D`) at 25 \eqn{^\circ} C was significantly different from the other two temperatures,
#' while there was not significant difference in `D` between the storage temperatures of 4 and 10 \eqn{^\circ C}. Therefore, the non-linear mixed model was refitted
#' for two temperature classes (cool 4/10 \eqn{^\circ C}) and ambient (25 \eqn{^\circ C}). The shape parameter is fixed for the two temperature classes.
#' Placing random effects in `D` with cantaloupe variety as the clustering variable, the estimates of  `meanD410`, `sdD410`, `meanD25` and `sdD25` were obtained.
#' The present function represents the cultivar-specific variability about `D` at cool or ambient temperature as a normal distribution;
#' and a `D` value is sampled for every lot, assuming a different cantaloupe cultivar.
#' It is assumed that after the holding time, it is not possible that a contaminated lot become free of \emph{L. monocytogenes}. Therefore,
#' if by chance the rinds of all cantaloupes from a contaminated lot end up having zero counts, one cell will be assigned to one cantaloupe of the lot.
