\value{
A list of three elements:
\describe{
\item{\code{N}}{(\code{CFU}) A matrix of size \code{nLots} lots by \code{sizeLot} units representing the numbers of \emph{L. monocytogenes}
in the portions of frozen vegetables.}
\item{\code{ProbUnitPos}}{Lot-specific probability of contaminated portions or servings (vector).}
\item{\code{P}}{Mean prevalence of contaminated portions or servings (scalar).}
}
}
\description{
The \code{\link[=fvPortioning]{fvPortioning()}} function represents the portioning of a pack of frozen vegetables into a smaller unit. It is assumed that the microbial
cells present in a contaminated pack are distributed into servings following a beta-binomial distribution, although the algorithm only retains
one portion per pack (and not all the portions that can be obtained from a pack). The dispersion factor \code{bPort} represents the extent of cell
clustering in the frozen vegetables within the package. The fact that the algorithm takes into account that a contaminated pack can produce a
non-contaminated portion, enables the estimation of the prevalence of contaminated portions. It is assumed that the dispersion parameter and
the number of portions (that can be obtained from a pack) are independent of the microbial numbers.
}
\note{
A dispersion factor \eqn{bPort=1} represents moderate clustering of cells \insertCite{Nauta2005;textual}{qraLm} in the frozen vegetables
within the package.
