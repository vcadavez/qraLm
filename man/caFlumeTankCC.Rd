\value{
A list of two elements of the data objects:
\describe{
\item{\code{N}}{(\code{CFU}) A matrix of size \code{nLots} lots by \code{sizeLot} units representing the numbers of \emph{L. monocytogenes}
on washed cantaloupes.}
\item{\code{P}}{Prevalence of contaminated harvested lots post-washing (scalar).}
}
}
\description{
The function \code{\link[=caFlumeTankCC]{caFlumeTankCC()}} function simulates the potential contamination of cantaloupe, when in direct
contact with contaminated water in flume tank.
The cross-contamination algorithm accounts for four possible scenarios:
\enumerate{
\item cross-contamination occurring in lots already contaminated;
\item re-contamination occurring in lots that were not contaminated;
\item no cross-contamination occurring in lots already contaminated; and
\item no cross-contamination occurring in lots that were not contaminated.
