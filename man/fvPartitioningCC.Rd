\value{
A list of three elements:
\describe{
\item{\code{N}}{(\code{CFU}) A matrix of size \code{nLots} lots by \code{sizeLot} units representing the numbers of \emph{L. monocytogenes} per pack unit,
from contaminated lots;}
\item{\code{ProbUnitPos}}{Probability of individual lots being contaminated after packaging (a lot is considered contaminated if at
least one pack unit is contaminated) (vector);}
\item{\code{P}}{Mean prevalence of contaminated lots after packaging (scalar).}
}
}
\description{
The \code{\link[=fvPartitioningCC]{fvPartitioningCC()}} function simulates the potential re-contamination of vegetables post-blanching, when in direct
contact with contaminated surfaces of conveyors, freezer or packaging machine, followed by the partitioning of the bulk
of frozen vegetables into packed units.
The cross-contamination algorithm accounts for four possible scenarios:
\enumerate{
\item cross-contamination occurring in lots already contaminated;
\item re-contamination occurring in lots that were not contaminated;
\item no cross-contamination occurring in lots already contaminated; and
\item no cross-contamination occurring in lots that were not contaminated.
}
Probabilities of occurrence of every event are computed. The partitioning algorithm randomly distributes the total numbers of cells from a
contaminated lot into packed units. The dispersion factor \code{b}, which is a parameter of the beta distribution, indicates the
extent of cell clustering in the bulk of frozen vegetables in a lot, and ultimately the heterogeneity in the number of cells
distributed among pack units.

\note{
The value of \eqn{probCC=0.125} is taken from \insertCite{Truchado2021;textual}{qraLm}, who analysed the presence of \emph{L. monocytogenes} on
conveyor belts, freezing tunnels and packaging machines in frozen food processing plants. The value of beta=1 represents moderate
clustering of cells in the bulk of frozen vegetables from a lot \insertCite{Nauta2005;textual}{qraLm}. \insertCite{Hoelzer2012;textual}{qraLm}
established the log 10 of the transfer coefficient of \emph{L. monocytogenes} from stainless steel to vegetables as a normal
distribution with \eqn{TR\_mean=-0.44} and \eqn{TR\_sd=0.40}.
